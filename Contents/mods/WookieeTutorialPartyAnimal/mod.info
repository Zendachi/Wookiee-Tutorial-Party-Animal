name=YOUR MOD NAME GOES HERE (I usually make mine match my the name of my workshop item)
poster=poster.png
id=YourModNameGoesHere (!!!!!!!!) (I would write your mod name exactly like this, which is known as PascalCase. The spacing between name, poster, id, and description is optional)
description= <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> This is an example template for creating mods that revolve around manipulating the functions and fields of Lua tables (which is to say the sort of mods that do not add new models, images, animations, sounds, or maps to the game). This mod demonstrates the basic directory structure for a workshop item featuring a single mod named Wookiee Tutorial: Party Animal and identified in an .ini file as WookieeTutorialPartyAnimal. A mod with this sort of format could be used to add unique game functionality, such as new context options, new UI panels, new shortcuts, new skills, new traits, and more. This mod adds one example trait called Party Animal, with an accompanying image. <LINE>  <LINE> In order to add a new line here, you must use the " <" followed by "LINE" followed by "> ". Do not forget the spaces around the tag, or the tag will not work! You can also use " <" and "> " around "RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0" to set the RGB color of this font  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> like so!  <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> If you want to add a requirement, simply use a "require=" tag below the "description" in this mod's  <RGB:0.3,0.7,0.3> mod.info  <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> file, and add a semicolon-separated list of the mod IDs you would like to include. The ID of this mod is  <RGB:0.3,0.7,0.3> WookieeTutorialPartyAnimal  <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> (as indicated in this mod's  <RGB:0.3,0.7,0.3> mod.info  <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> file on "id=" line). The ID of Mod Options is  <RGB:0.3,0.7,0.3> modoptions <RGB:0.7,0.7,0.7> .  <LINE>  <LINE>  <RGB:1.0,0.6,0.0> Mod ID detection is case sensitive! Capital letters must stay capitalized, and lowercase letters must be lowercase. Always copy mod IDs carefully!
