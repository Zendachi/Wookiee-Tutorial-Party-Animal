description=This mod demonstrates the basic directory structure for a workshop item featuring a single mod named Wookiee Tutorial: Party Animal and identified in an .ini file as WookieeTutorialPartyAnimal. A mod with this sort of format could be used to add unique game functionality, such as new context options, new UI panels, new shortcuts, new skills, new traits, and more.

description=This mod adds one example trait called Party Animal, with an accompanying icon and some basic functionality that is tied to having the trait. This Workshop Item is not meant to be used on servers; it is intended to help new modders learn better practices and some useful tricks for setting up a very basic mod of this sort.

description=This mod also demonstrates the use of a local module as a container for various fields and functions that achieve some sort of collective purpose.
description=
description=The code is intended to be read by modders who download it. It has many comments that explain how various aspects of the mod work together. After subscribing, you will find this mod in the same Steam folder as your Zomboid installation:

description=Many better modders than me lurk in the #mod_discussion channel of [url=https://discord.com/invite/theindiestone]the Project Zomboid Discord[/url] (and they are usually happy to help new people who get stuck). You are welcome to ask for advice in that channel whenever you get lost in the sauce! I may even be the one who replies, if I happen to be around. You are welcome to try pinging me directly, but I obviously cannot promise to be available.
